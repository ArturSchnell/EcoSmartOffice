# Svelte + TS + Vite

To start the client, the `.env` must first be created. The .env.example can be used for this.

The `docker-compose build` command must then be called within the client folder. Once the process is complete, the container with the Svelte client can be started with `docker-compose up`.

By default, http://localhost:5173 can then be called here.
